By ANUSHA BHAVANAM
This web app is a project for the Udacity [FSND Course](https://www.udacity.com/course/full-stack-web-developer-nanodegree--nd004).

## About
This project is a RESTful web application utilizing the Flask framework which accesses a SQL database that populates book categories and their editions. OAuth2 provides authentication for further CRUD functionality on the application. Currently OAuth2 is implemented for Google Accounts.

## In This Project
This project has one main Python module `main.py` which runs the Flask application. A SQL database is created using the `Data_Setup.py` module and you can populate the database with test data using `database_init.py`.
The Flask application uses stored HTML templates in the tempaltes folder to build the front-end of the application.
